        <p><br>A potentially habitable planet implies a terrestrial planetswithin the circumstellar habitable zone and with conditions roughly comparable to those of Earth and thus potentially
            favourable to Earth-like life.[However, the question of what makes a planet habitable is much more complex than having a planet located at the right distance from its host star so that water can be liquid on its surface: various geophysicaland
            geodynamics aspects, the radiation, and the host star's plasma environment can influence the evolution of planets and life, if it originated.In November 2013, astronomers reported, based on <em>keplar space mission</em>data,
            that there could be as many as 40 billion Earth sized planets orbiting in the habitable zones of sun like stars and red drawfs in the milky way 11 billion of which may be orbiting Sun-like stars.A 2015 review concluded
            that the exoplanets keplar 422b and keplar 455b  were likely the best candidates for being potentially habitable. These are at a distance of 1,200, 490 and 1,120 light years aaway, respectively. Of these, Kepler-186f
            is similar in size to Earth with a 1.2-Earth-radius measure and it is located towards the outer edge of the habitable zone around its red dwarf.<br><br></p>

                                a study in 2018 by Mullally et al. implied that statistically, Kepler-452b has not been proven to exist and must still be considered a candidate. It is the first potentially rocky super-Earth planet discovered orbiting
